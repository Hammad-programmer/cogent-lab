His parents were \\nvery hard- working and deeply religious people, but so poor \\nthat they lived with their five children in only two rooms. \\nThe father and mother spent their evenings in reading aloud \\nto their children, generally from books of a serious charac -\\nter.\\nThough always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out \\nthird in the final examination of the Petersburg school of \\nEngineering. There he had already begun his first work, \\n‘Poor Folk.’\\nThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his \\nreview and was received with acclamations. The shy, un -\\nknown youth found himself instantly something of a \\ncelebrity. A brilliant and successful career seemed to open \\nbefore him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he \\nwas arrested.\\nThough neither by temperament nor conviction a revolu -\\ntionist, Dostoevsky was one of a little group of young men \\nwho met together to read Fourier and Proudhon. He was ac -\\ncused of ‘taking part in conversations against the censorship, \\nof reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of knowing \\nof the intention to set up a printing press.’ Under Nicholas I.

After eight \\nmonths’ imprisonment he was with twenty-one others tak -\\nen out to the Semyonovsky Square to be shot. Writing to his \\nbrother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: ‘They snapped words over \\nour heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by \\npersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in \\nthrees to stakes, to suffer execution. Being the third in the \\nrow, I concluded I had only a few minutes of life before me. \\nI thought of you and your dear ones and I contrived to kiss \\nPlestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to bid \\nthem farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were \\nunbound, brought back upon the scaffold, and informed \\nthat his Majesty had spared us our lives.’ The sentence was \\ncommuted to hard labour.\\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he \\nwas untied, and never regained his sanity.\\nThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting \\nstamp on Dostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper \\nled him in the end to accept every suffering with resignation \\nand to regard it as a blessing in his own case, he constantly \\nrecurs to the subject in his writings. He describes the awful \\nagony of the condemned man and insists on the cruelty of \\ninflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal \\nservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in \\nSiberia, where he began the ‘Dead House,’ and some years \\nof service in a disciplinary battalion.\\nHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease be -\\nfore his arrest and this now developed into violent attacks of '),\n",

The \\nfits occurred three or four times a year and were more fre -\\nquent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was allowed to \\nreturn to Russia. He started a journal— ‘Vremya,’ which was \\nforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. \\nIn 1864 he lost his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was \\nin terrible poverty, yet he took upon himself the payment \\nof his brother’s debts. He started another journal—‘The Ep -\\noch,’ which within a few months was also prohibited. He \\nwas weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was depen -\\ndent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, \\nand is said never to have corrected his work. The later years \\nof his life were much softened by the tenderness and devo -\\ntion of his second wife.\\nIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveil -\\ning of the monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was \\nreceived with extraordinary demonstrations of love and \\nhonour.\\nA few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to \\nthe grave by a vast multitude of mourners, who ‘gave the \\nhapless man the funeral of a king.’ He is still probably the \\nmost widely read writer in Russia.\\nIn the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the \\nfeeling inspired by Dostoevsky: ‘He was one of ourselves, a \\nman of our blood and our bone, but one who has suffered \\nand has seen so much more deeply than we have his insight \\nimpresses us as wisdom … that wisdom of the heart which \\nwe seek that we may learn from it how to live.

His garret was under the roof of a high, five-sto -\\nried house and was more like a cupboard than a room. The \\nlandlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and at -\\ntendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went \\nout he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which \\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young \\nman had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl \\nand feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, \\nand was afraid of meeting her.\\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite \\nthe contrary; but for some time past he had been in an over -\\nstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He \\nhad become so completely absorbed in himself, and iso -\\nlated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only \\nhis landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, \\nbut the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh \\nupon him.

It is not serious at all. It’s \\nsimply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe \\nit is a plaything.’\\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the \\nbustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about \\nhim, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all \\nwho are unable to get out of town in summer—all worked \\npainfully upon the young man’s already overwrought \\nnerves.

He was, by the way, \\nexceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, \\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. \\nSoon he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speak -\\ning into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not \\nobserving what was about him and not caring to observe it. \\nFrom time to time, he would mutter something, from the \\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. \\nAt these moments he would become conscious that his ideas \\nwere sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for \\ntwo days he had scarcely tasted food.\\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to \\nshabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street \\nin such rags.

But there was such accu -\\nmulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, \\nthat, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded \\nhis rags least of all in the street.

It was a tall round hat \\nfrom Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with \\nage, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side \\nin a most unseemly fashion. Not shame, however, but quite \\nanother feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.\\n‘I knew it,’ he muttered in confusion, ‘I thought so! That’s \\nthe worst of all!

This house was let out in \\ntiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all \\nkinds—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of sorts, girls \\npicking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc. There \\nwas a continual coming and going through the two gates \\nand in the two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-\\nkeepers were employed on the building. The young man \\nwas very glad to meet none of them, and at once slipped un -\\nnoticed through the door on the right, and up the staircase. \\nIt was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar \\nwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these sur -\\nroundings: in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes \\nwere not to be dreaded.\\n‘If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow \\ncame to pass that I were really going to do it?’ he could not \\nhelp asking himself as he reached the fourth storey. There \\nhis progress was barred by some porters who were engaged \\nin moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the flat had \\nbeen occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and \\nhis family. This German was moving out then, and so the \\nfourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by \\nthe old woman. ‘That’s a good thing anyway,’ he thought to \\nhimself, as he rang the bell of the old woman’s flat. The bell \\ngave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of '),\n",

He had forgotten the note of that bell, and \\nnow its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something \\nand to bring it clearly before him…. He started, his nerves \\nwere terribly overstrained by now. In a little while, the door \\nwas opened a tiny crack: the old woman eyed her visitor \\nwith evident distrust through the crack, and nothing could \\nbe seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness. But, \\nseeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, \\nand opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the \\ndark entry, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitch -\\nen. The old woman stood facing him in silence and looking \\ninquiringly at him. She was a diminutive, withered up old \\nwoman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp lit -\\ntle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly \\nsmeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round \\nher thin long neck, which looked like a hen’s leg, was knot -\\nted some sort of flannel rag, and, in spite of the heat, there \\nhung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy fur cape, yellow \\nwith age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every in -\\nstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather \\npeculiar expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her \\neyes again.\\n‘Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,’ the \\nyoung man made haste to mutter, with a half bow, remem -\\nbering that he ought to be more polite.\\n‘I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your \\ncoming here,’ the old woman said distinctly, still keeping \\nher inquiring eyes on his face.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘And here … I am again on the same errand,’ Raskol -\\nnikov continued, a little disconcerted and surprised at \\nthe old woman’s mistrust. ‘Perhaps she is always like that \\nthough, only I did not notice it the other time,’ he thought \\nwith an uneasy feeling.\\nThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then \\nstepped on one side, and pointing to the door of the room, \\nshe said, letting her visitor pass in front of her:\\n‘Step in, my good sir.’\\nThe little room into which the young man walked, with \\nyellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains \\nin the windows, was brightly lighted up at that moment by \\nthe setting sun.\\n‘So the sun will shine like this then  too!’ flashed as it were \\nby chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid \\nglance he scanned everything in the room, trying as far as \\npossible to notice and remember its arrangement. But there \\nwas nothing special in the room. The furniture, all very old \\nand of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent \\nwooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-\\ntable with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, \\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in \\nyellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in \\ntheir hands—that was all. In the corner a light was burning \\nbefore a small ikon. Everything was very clean; the floor and \\nthe furniture were brightly polished; everything shone.\\n‘Lizaveta’s work,’ thought the young man.

These two rooms made up the whole flat.\\n‘What do you want?’ the old woman said severely, com -\\ning into the room and, as before, standing in front of him so \\nas to look him straight in the face.\\n‘I’ve brought something to pawn here,’ and he drew out \\nof his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back \\nof which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel.\\n‘But the time is up for your last pledge.

He could hear her unlock -\\ning the chest of drawers.\\n‘It must be the top drawer,’ he reflected. ‘So she carries \\nthe keys in a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel \\nring…. And there’s one key there, three times as big as all \\nthe others, with deep notches; that can’t be the key of the \\nchest of drawers … then there must be some other chest or \\nstrong-box … that’s worth knowing.
